			<p>Nebula is a lazy house cat currently living in Austin, Tx with her owner Amber. She enjoys laying on the couch, laying on her cat tree, laying on the floor, laying on her owner, and eating. Her favorite foods include cat food, and whatever is on her owners plate.<br>...just as long as it is on her owners plate still. Otherwise, forget it.<br><br><br></p>
			<p>When Nebula is not lounging around her North Austin home, she is lounging around in front of a camera. She is currently an amateur instagram model who has gained 8 followers. She will continue to gain a following in hopes of pursuing her dreams of becoming the star of a Friskies commercial.</p>
